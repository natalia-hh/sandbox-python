# City Map Route Planner

This project provides a Python script for planning a route through a city map. It generates a random city map grid, where each cell can be either passable or impassable. Given the location of a courier and the locations of orders, the script calculates an efficient route that the courier can follow to reach all orders based on their proximity.

## Features

- Generate random city map
- Calculate the shortest path to each order from the courier's location.
- Sort orders by distance from the courier's current location.
- Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for pathfinding.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Math
- Collections
- Random
